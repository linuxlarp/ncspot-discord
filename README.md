> Discord presence adapter for [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)

A simple, lightweight, python based extension to display [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot) data from a socket to your Discord Profile using Discords RPC Protocol and PyPresence.


## Why?
By default, ncspot does not interact with the Discord RPC, nor does it support it. This program acts a middleman and adapter for that missing bridge. For people who want to show what their playing to their friends on Discord, this program also serves as a replacement for several similar projects that are no longer supported or outdated.

## Prerequisites
- [Discord Client](https://discord.com) or [Vesktop/Vencord](https://vencord.dev)
- [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)
- **Linux** or Unix Based System *(Linux is the only platform we currently support, future compatibility expected in another update)*
