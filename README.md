# ncspot-discord
> Discord presence adapter for [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)

A simple, lightweight, python based extension to display [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot) data from a socket to your Discord Profile using Discords RPC Protocol and PyPresence.


# Why?
By default, ncspot does not interact with the Discord RPC, nor does it support it. This program acts a middleman and adapter for that missing bridge. For people who want to show what their playing to their friends on Discord, this program also serves as a replacement for several similar projects that are no longer supported or outdated.

# Prerequisites
- [Discord Client](https://discord.com) or [Vesktop/Vencord](https://vencord.dev)
- [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)
- Linux/UNIX Based System (Linux is officially supported as of now)

# Warning
This project is currently unfinished, basic functionality is guaranteed but features that you may expect may not be present until a later date, and this program is not officially packaged on PyPi or compiled for any other package mirrors.
